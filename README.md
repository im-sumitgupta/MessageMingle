## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- A Firebase project set up

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/group-chat-app.git


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/group-chat-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd group-chat-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Set up Firebase for your project:
   - Add the `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) to your Flutter project.
   - Ensure Firebase is configured correctly in your Flutter project.

## Usage

1. Run the app on your preferred device or emulator:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
2. Register a new user or log in with existing credentials.
3. Create a new group or join an existing one.
4. Start chatting in real-time with group members.

## Firebase Configuration

To set up Firebase:

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Enable Firebase Authentication.
3. Set up Firestore Database.
4. Add the necessary configuration files to your Flutter project.

## Authentication

Firebase Authentication is used to handle user registration and login. The app supports email and password authentication. Invalid credentials are handled gracefully, with appropriate error messages displayed to the user.

## Database Management

Firestore is used to store user data, group information, and messages. The data is structured in collections and documents as follows:

- **Users Collection**: Stores user profiles with fields like `email`, `fullName`, and `groups`.
- **Messages Collection**: Nested within each group document, storing messages with fields like `sender`, `content`, and `timestamp`.

CRUD operations are implemented for managing groups, messages, and user data.

## Shared Preferences

Shared Preferences are used to persist user login status and profile information locally. This allows the app to maintain user sessions and preferences across app restarts.

## Future Improvements

- **Push Notifications**: Implement push notifications for new messages.
- **Media Sharing**: Allow users to share images and files within groups.
- **UI Enhancements**: Improve the UI/UX with animations and better theme support.
- **Offline Support**: Enhance offline capabilities to allow message caching and delayed sending.
